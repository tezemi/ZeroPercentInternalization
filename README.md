# Zero Percent Internalization
Zero Percent Internalization is a lightweight text internalization/localization library for Unity. ZPI stores text files as Unity-tracked assets using a key-value pair system for looking up text based on the configured language. These assets are stored as human-readable JSON so translators may make changes without Unity or Unity experience.

# Installation
The easiest way to install ZPI is to install it as a package.
1. Window -> Package Manager
2. Click the "+" button.
3. Select "Add package from git URL."
4. Enter the following URL: `https://github.com/tezemi/ZeroPercentInternalization.git`
5. Click "Add."

# Dependencies
- ZPI requires Unity UI and TextMeshPro, these can be downloaded through the Unity Package Manager, and should be downloaded automatically.
- ZPI also requires [JSON.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json). This will **not be downloaded automatically, and must be installed manually**. How you decide to include it in your project is up to you, although I recommend [NuGetForUnity](https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity).
